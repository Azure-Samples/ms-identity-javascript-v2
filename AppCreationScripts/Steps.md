## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Vanilla JavaScript SPA application calling the Microsoft Graph.

## Scenario

1. The client Vanilla JavaScript SPA application uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD**:
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the Microsoft Graph protected  **Azure AD**.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed to run this sample.
- A modern web browser. This sample uses **ES6** conventions and will not run on **Internet Explorer**.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for running and editing this sample.
- [VS Code Azure Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extension is recommended for interacting with Azure through VS Code Interface.
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your **Azure AD**. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-v2.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: Given that the name of the sample is quite long, and so are the names of the referenced packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid maximum file path length limitations on Windows.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

```console
    cd ms-identity-javascript-v2
    npm install
```

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the spa app (ms-identity-javascript-v2)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-v2`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Single-Page Application** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Click on the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the spa app (ms-identity-javascript-v2) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `app\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-v2` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_HereEnter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"+$tenantName.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here` and replace the existing value with the Redirect URI for ms-identity-javascript-v2 app. For example, 'http://localhost:3000/' .

## Running the sample

```console
    cd ms-identity-javascript-v2
    npm start
```

## Deployment

### Deployment to Azure Storage

There is one single-page application in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure Storage**, you'll need to:

- create an Azure Storage blob
- build your project and upload it
- update config files with website coordinates

> :information_source: If you would like to use **VS Code Azure Tools** extension for deployment, [watch the tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial-vscode-static-website-node-01) offered by Microsoft Docs.

#### Build and upload the `ms-identity-javascript-v2` to an Azure Storage blob

Build your project to get a distributable files folder, where your built `html`, `css` and `javascript` files will be generated. Then follow the steps below:

> :warning: When uploading, make sure you upload the contents of your distributable files folder and **not** the entire folder itself.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Locate your storage account and display the account overview.
1. Select **Static website** to display the configuration page for static websites.
1. Select **Enabled** to enable static website hosting for the storage account.
1. In the **Index document name** field, specify a default index page (For example: `index.html`).
1. The default **index page** is displayed when a user navigates to the root of your static website.
1. Click **Save**. The Azure portal now displays your static website endpoint. Make a note of the **Primary endpoint field**.
1. In the `ms-identity-javascript-v2` project source code, update your configuration file with the **Primary endpoint field** as your new **Redirect URI** (you will register this URI later).
1. Next, select **Storage Explorer**.
1. Expand the **BLOB CONTAINERS** node, and then select the `$web` container.
1. Choose the **Upload** button to upload files.
1. If you intend for the browser to display the contents of file, make sure that the content type of that file is set to `text/html`.
1. In the pane that appears beside the **account overview page** of your storage account, select **Static Website**. The URL of your site appears in the **Primary endpoint field**. In the next section, you will register this URI.

##### Update the Azure AD app registration for `ms-identity-javascript-v2`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.
1. In the resulting screen, select the `ms-identity-javascript-v2` application.
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://ms-identity-javascript-v2-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://ms-identity-javascript-v2-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URI in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect URIs, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's URI for each redirect URI.
