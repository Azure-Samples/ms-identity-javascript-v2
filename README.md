# Vanilla JavaScript Single-page Application secured with MSAL.js

A simple vanilla JavaScript single-page application which demonstrates how to configure [MSAL.JS 2.x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/msal-browser) to login, logout, and acquire an access token for a protected resource such as the **Microsoft Graph API**. This version of the MSAL.js library uses the [authorization code flow with PKCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).

**Note:** A quickstart guide covering this sample can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-javascript-auth-code).

|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `app`             | Contains sample source files               |
| `authPopup.js`    | Main authentication logic resides here (using Popup flow).            |
| `authRedirect.js` | Use this instead of `authPopup.js` for authentication with redirect flow.   |
| `authConfig.js`   | Contains configuration parameters for the sample.      |
| `graph.js`        | Provides a helper function for calling MS Graph API.   |
| `graphConfig.js`  | Contains API endpoints for MS Graph.       |
| `ui.js`           | Contains UI logic.                         |
| `index.html`      |  Contains the UI of the sample.            |
| `.gitignore`      | Define what to ignore at commit time.      |
| `package.json`    | Package manifest for npm.                  |
| `server.js`     | Implements a simple Node server to serve index.html.  |

## Prerequisites

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed to run this sample.

## Setup

1. [Register a new application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-app-registration) in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that the application is enabled for the [authorization code flow with PKCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow). This will require that you redirect URI configured in the portal is of type `SPA`.
2. Open the [/app/authConfig.js](./app/authConfig.js) file and provide the required configuration values.
3. On the command line, navigate to the root of the repository, and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies via npm.

## Running the sample

1. Configure authentication and authorization parameters:
   1. Open `authConfig.js`
   2. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Application_Id_Here"` with your app/client ID on AAD Portal.
   3. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_HereEnter_the_Tenant_Info_Here"` with `"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/"` (*note*: This is for multi-tenant applications located on the global Azure cloud. For more information, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-javascript-auth-code)).
   4. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here"` with the redirect uri you setup on AAD Portal.
2. Configure the parameters for calling MS Graph API:
   1. Open `graphConfig.js`.
   2. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me"` with `"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me"`.
   3. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me/messages"` with `"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages"`.
3. To start the sample application, run `npm start`.
4. Finally, open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Key concepts

This sample demonstrates the following MSAL workflows:

* How to configure application parameters.
* How to sign-in with popup and redirect methods.
* How to sign-out.
* How to get user consent incrementally.
* How to acquire an access token.
* How to make an API call with the access token.
